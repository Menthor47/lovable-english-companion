## Service Rationale

### Why These Tiers Work

1. **Clear Value Ladder**: Each tier has distinct features customers can understand and choose.
2. **Upsell Path**: Clear progression from Starter → Business → Enterprise (prevents commoditization).
3. **Competitive Differentiation**:
   - **Tier 1** beats basic/budget competitors on transparency + quality (not cheapest).
   - **Tier 2** beats mid-market on content quality + guest posting + ROI focus.
   - **Tier 3** wins on dedicated support, AI/automation, white-label options.
4. **Profit Margins**: 
   - Tier 1: Likely 50-60% margin (efficient delivery, templates, automation).
   - Tier 2: 55-65% margin (more custom, higher delivery cost offset by scale).
   - Tier 3: 60-70%+ margin (dedicated account manager is salesman, high-touch justifies premium pricing).

| Tier 1 rarely includes link building | **Include 2-3 press releases + citations** from day 1 |
| Weak content strategy | **Pillar-cluster model** in Tier 2+ (builds topical authority fast) |

## Implementation Tips

1. **Onboarding**: Day 1 kickoff call, send welcome packet with login credentials, set up reporting dashboard.
2. **Monthly Delivery**: Content calendar (Tier 1: 3 months out; Tier 2: quarterly; Tier 3: annual roadmap).
3. **Quality Assurance**: 
   - Tier 1: Automated checks + spot audits (20% of deliverables).
   - Tier 2: Peer review before delivery + monthly QA call.
   - Tier 3: Quality review + client approval gate before publication.
4. **Scaling**: 
   - Use templates (Tier 1) → customize (Tier 2) → fully custom (Tier 3).
   - Consider white-label team or outsourcing low-touch tasks (content creation, citations).
5. **Upsell Triggers**:
   - After 3 months in Tier 1, if rankings don't move: "Need more aggressive link building? Tier 2 includes guest posting."
   - After 6 months in Tier 2, if still not top 3: "CRO module can help convert that traffic better."
